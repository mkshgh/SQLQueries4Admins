# SQL QUERIES FOR SUPER ADMINS

Will keep on updating as I encounter more of these. 
These are more useful for the system admininstrators working with the sql server a lot.
Some of these queries have saved my ass a lot of times ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠâœŒâœŒ

## 1.RecreateAllUsersWithRoles.sql

Lets say you need to transfer or recreate all the users in the entire server with thier privileges to a multiple DBs, it is time consuming to go and create the backup of all the users and transfer them to the new one. Maybe you forgot to take the backup of the users and it was late before you figured it out. This generates a table with code to do all that which you can copy paste and run. And BAZINGA! you have all your users all over the db again like magic.\
This also takes count of the sql **Error: 15138**\
Just create the user LOGIN before running the code if there are none.


### STEPS USED:

- Search for all the dbs in the server FOR a SPECIFIC USER ONLY\
- Get the list of roles for this user in all the DBs except the excluded ones\
- Create a query to delete all the existing users and login, add new login and associate the users to the given DB with the roles extracted.

### USAGE:

<code>
-- copy the generated code to the target server and relax and wait.
</code>

Say you have to search all the database for a specific users and some of the users are not in the login. In that case, just searching through the table **sys.sysusers** table won't cut it. Use this script to list all the users whether they have a adjacent login in the system or not. It will show you all the users list
